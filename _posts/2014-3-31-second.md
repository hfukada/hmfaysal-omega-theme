I am a Computer Engineer that loves to tinker with code. I believe that there is innumerable value in being able to write command line programs for academia, but the best code and projects are those that can be put on display for the world to appreciate and use. The idea primarily stems from the fact that I love to have things recognized as my own creation. It is very empowering to see someone using your code and products. I code for a hobby and play around with computers. I enjoy a good challenge and like to solve puzzles and games.
